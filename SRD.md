## Introduction  
*Stack & Spiral* is a personality-driven RPG engine for narrative collapse—a game of falling beautifully together. It’s about characters defined by their flaws, unraveling under pressure, and spiraling toward something inevitable. This SRD provides the core mechanics; settings like *Lowhollow* and *Hundred Acre Group Therapy* show it in action. For deeper guidance on resets and tone, seek *Fragments of the Undoable* zines.  

---

## Core Concepts  
Characters in *Stack & Spiral* are fragile engines of emotion, built from five Functions (rated +3 to -2). Rolls (1d20 + Function) test their strengths and flaws against the world. Spiral Points (or setting variants like Quiet Sigh Points, Oh Bother Points) are earned through vulnerability—spend them to reroll, trigger flaws, or push the story. The Spiral Track (or Doom, Loneliness) counts collective entropy; at 10, something breaks.  

### Spiraling Together (Sidebar)  
*From Fragments of the Undoable: The Etiquette of Emotional Unraveling*  
- Play to flaw, not harm—your dysfunction is a gift.  
- Fail beautifully—let your stumbles echo.  
- Step out if it hits too close—tap the table, we’ll wait.  
- Spiral soft enough to be felt—name the pain, don’t perform it.  
- End with a truth you didn’t mean to say—that’s the spiral’s mark.  
*Full guide in Fragments of the Undoable.*

## Rolls  
Roll 1d20 + Function vs. a Difficulty (Easy 10, Medium 15, Hard 18). Success moves the story; failure earns a Spiral Point if it’s vulnerable or flawed. Ties teeter—narrate the edge.

## Spiral Mechanics  
### Spiral Points  
Earn them by:  
- Failing a roll “at the worst possible moment.”  
- Falling beautifully into your Flaw Trigger.  
Spend them to:  
- Reroll a die (yours or another’s).  
- Trigger someone’s Flaw Trigger (with consent).  
- Activate a Special Move (setting-specific).  
*Settings may reflavor as Quiet Sigh Points, Oh Bother Points, etc.*  

### The Spiral Track  
A group counter (0-10). Ticks when:  
- Spiral Points are spent recklessly.  
- Flaws spiral out of control.  
- The setting demands it (e.g., a storm in *Lowhollow*).  
At 10, the world shifts—someone breaks, reality frays, or the end begins. Reset it only with an impossible act (see below).  
*Settings may reflavor as Doom Track, Loneliness Track, etc.*  

### Ritual Reversals: Resetting the Spiral  
To reset the Spiral Track (or its variants), perform an impossible act—a fragile, narrative shift. Choose or roll (1d6). Costs may apply (e.g., Roll Connection, Hard 18).  
*Examples:*  
- **Lowhollow:**  
  1. Apologize in front of Hush.  
  2. Burn something you swore you’d keep.  
  3. Share a silence that hurts to hold.  
- **Hundred Acre Group Therapy:**  
  1. Admit the honeypot was empty all along.  
  2. Hug Eeyore without explaining why.  
  3. Give Eeyore the last word.

## Character Creation  
1. **Functions:** Assign +3, +2, +1, 0, -2 to five traits (e.g., Reason, Impulse, Recall, Wonder, Connection). Reflavor for settings (e.g., Stillness in *Lowhollow*, Murk in *Lowhollow*).  
2. **Flaw Trigger:** Define a weakness tied to your lowest Function—when it fires, earn a Spiral Point.  
3. **Special Move:** A setting-specific trick (optional)—spend a Spiral Point to use it.  

---

## Optional Mechanics  
- **Shadow Integration:** Roll against your lowest Function to face inner chaos; success may boost it temporarily.  
- **The Voice:** A GM tool—narrates the spiral’s whispers.  
- **Chaos Dice:** Roll 1d6 alongside 1d20—on a 1, something twists.  

---

## Settings  
This SRD is a chassis—reflavor Functions, Tracks, and Moves for your world. See *Lowhollow* and *Hundred Acre Group Therapy* for examples. More in *Fragments of the Undoable*.  

---

## Notes  
- Safety first—pause if the spiral cuts too deep.  
- Consent matters—trigger Flaws with agreement.  
- Collapse is the goal—don’t fight it.

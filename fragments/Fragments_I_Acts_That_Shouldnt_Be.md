### How to Use This Table  
When a setting uses a Spiral Track, Loneliness Meter, Doom Timer, or Ritual Clock, the only way to reset it is often to do something "impossible."  

But what does "impossible" mean? This table offers unsettling, poetic, and setting-tuned examples of narrative resets—fragile acts that might reverse entropy or invite a different spiral.  

Choose or roll (1d6) per setting.  
**For added chaos:** Roll twice and let the table pick which sticks.  
> *They’ll choose what breaks you best.*

- Everyone loses a Spiral Point but you.  
- Tick the Spiral Track anyway.  
- Name something you’ll never get back.  
- Roll Connection (Hard 18) to make it stick.  
- Break your Special Move now *(it worked too well)*.

**Read This Before You Spiral**  
*Etiquette isn’t about control. It’s about care.*  
The table doesn’t need perfect metaphors.  
It needs your tenderness, your silence, your fall.  
These aren’t rules. They’re reminders.  
Fold them once. Keep them close.  
Use them when you’re about to say too much—or not enough.

### Ten Reminders from the Spiral  
*(Each one a nudge toward collective collapse)*  

1. **Play to Flaw, Not Harm**  
Your dysfunction is a gift. Don’t hand it to someone else still unwrapping theirs.  

2. **Fail Like Someone Is Watching Who Used to Love You**  
Let your stumbles echo. Make them beautiful. Make them hurt.  

3. **Embrace the Awkward Pause**  
It’s not silence. It’s the sound of the spiral breathing in.  

4. **Narrate Like No One Can Fix It**  
Let your choices dangle. Let the hurt sit in the room. Don’t rush the repair.  

5. **Your Character Is a Mirror With a Crack in It**  
Let someone else see themselves in your fracture.  

6. **Hold the Flaw Up to the Light Before You Drop It**  
Let the moment shimmer. Then let it break.  

7. **You Can Always Step Out of the Clearing**  
If it hits too close, fade the scene. Tap the table. Raise a hand. We’ll wait.  

8. **Let Someone Else’s Spiral Steal the Scene—and Hold Its Shadow**  
Spotlight doesn’t mean stage. Be the echo, the witness, the weight behind the door.  

9. **Spiral Loud Enough to Be Heard, Soft Enough to Be Felt**  
You don’t have to perform the pain. Just name it, gently.  

10. **End the Session With a Truth You Didn’t Mean to Say**  
Truths don’t leave. They linger. That’s how you know it worked.

### Marginalia, Scribbled in a Different Hand:  
> “Etiquette is just another word for how we survive each other.”  
> “Some apologies echo louder than screams.”  
> “The spiral thanks you for your vulnerability. She will not return it.”  
> “The woods don’t judge. We might.”  
> *_You are not alone in the woods._*

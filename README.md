# Stack & Spiral SRD

**A storytelling engine for emotional collapse, narrative unraveling, and spiraling beautifully together.**

This is the official **System Reference Document (SRD)** for **Stack & Spiral**, a lightweight TTRPG engine licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0). It was designed to tell stories about failure, vulnerability, and what happens when we stop trying to win.

## 🌪️ What Is Stack & Spiral?

**Stack & Spiral** is a modular RPG framework that uses five core functions:

- **Reason**  
- **Impulse**  
- **Recall**  
- **Wonder**  
- **Connection**

Players assign modifiers from +3 to –2, define a **Flaw Trigger**, and earn **Spiral Points** by leaning into emotional risk. A shared **Spiral Track** escalates tension across the table. Optional expansions add ritual resets, poetic etiquette, and chaos mechanics.

This SRD contains all the mechanics you need to design your own **Stack & Spiral** stories, hacks, or full systems.
